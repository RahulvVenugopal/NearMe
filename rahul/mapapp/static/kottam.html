Valluvar Kottam is located at the intersection of the Kodambakkam High road and the Village road in Nungambakkam neighbourhood of Chennai.The monument now stands at what was once the deepest point of a local lake called the Nungambakkam lake.The monument consists of a decorative arch, an auditorium that can accommodate around 3,500 people, and the Kural Manimandapa, where all the 1,330 couplets from all 133 chapters of the Kural literature are inscribed on bas-relief.The hallmark of the monument is the 39-meter-high (128 feet) stone car, a replica of the famed temple chariot of Thiruvarur.The chariot is made of around 3000 blocks of granite stone from Tiruvannamalai and weighs 2,700 tonnes. The largest of these stones weigh as much as 40 tonnes.The four giant-sized wheels of the chariot measure 11 feet in diameter and 2 feet in thickness. A life-size statue of Valluvar has been installed in the chariot.

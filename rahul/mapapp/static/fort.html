ort St. George (or historically, White Town) is a fortress at the coastal city of Chennai, India. Founded in 1639, it was the first English (later British) fortress in India.The construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements and trading activity, in what was originally an uninhabited land.Thus, it is a feasible contention to say that the city (formerly named Madras) evolved around the fortress.The fort currently houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and other official buildings.While the Fort Complex was initially meant to support a small trade post, it soon burgeoned into a bustling city that was divided into White Town, where the English and Europeans stayed and Black Town, where dock workers and locals stayed. Within its 20ft walls, the British constructed several iconic structures such as the Wellesley House (named for Richard Wellesley, a former Governor General of India), St. Maryâ€™s Church, a 150ft high Flag Staff, and the Fort Museum.
